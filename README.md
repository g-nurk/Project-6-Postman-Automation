Project 6 and also the last project was called: “Automating testing of Jira Clone Back-End API with Postman”. 

In this project we mostly used Postman and the existing APIs were: POST authentication; GET, PUT project; GET currentUser; POST, PUT, GET, DELETE issues; POST, PUT, GET, DELETE comments.

Project goal: Only some functionalities are partly covered with API automation tests: Create/Edit issue. The goal is to cover more functionalities by the API tests using Postman.

Functionalities to cover by back-end automation tests: Creating and updating tasks; Deleting tasks; Time tracking functionality (logging and estimations); Creating, editing and deleting task comments.

Important was to test the boundaries (for example, if the task name should only allow 200 symbols, what happens when 203 is used). For writing code, we used Postman Pre-request and Post-response scripts in addition to Body. 

I was victorious, leading to 100% result in project 6.

My Testing Automation Graduation Exam resulted in 100%.
